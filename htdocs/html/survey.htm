MajorCool Installation Survey
</H2>

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Out of curiosity, I began tracking installations of version 1.2.0
when it was released in Dec 1997. I was primarily interested in how
the various configuration options were being utilized. The
registration is optional; I don't know how many sites installed the 
software and didn't want to participate in the census for some
reason, but I'm guessing the collected data is a very small 
representation of the total user base. One thing is assured based
on the numbers collected: at least three new <I>MajorCool</I>
installations come to life each day.

<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Not suprisingly, most people just take the defaults during the 
initial install. However, I did notice some other possible "trends":
<UL>
<LI>The "friendly name" (<CODE>$sitename</CODE>) is most often set
to be a domain name. Only a handful of sites chose to use the name
for descriptive text as it was originally intended.
<LI>The "simple" <CODE>siteaddr()</CODE> module is by far the most 
common, which is not unreasonable considering that it matches the 
behavior of <I>Majordomo</I>. Those that have experimented with the 
pattern match feature have done so mostly via the "domain" and 
"domain-smtp" modules.
<LI>Far more sites chose "paranoid mode" (<CODE>$opt_cmdverify</CODE>)
than I would have expected. While this mode is certainly a good 
<I>Majordomo</I> syntax teaching tool, it does not make for an
efficient list management process...
<LI>It's a 50/50 split as far as sites wanting their CGI indexed by
Spiders &amp; Crawlers (<CODE>$opt_robots</CODE>).
<LI>I have yet to find anyone who turned off the Multipart Server-Push
support (<CODE>$opt_multipart</CODE>). Not surprising given its
no-harm-done "cool" factor.
<LI>More sites hide the admin password (<CODE>$opt_hiddenpasswd</CODE>)
than hide their list-of-lists (<CODE>$opt_hiddenlists</CODE>). This
surprises me since disabling hidden lists provides a way to bypass the
<I>Majordomo</I> <CODE>advertise/noadvertise</CODE> security.

</UL>
<P ALIGN=LEFT>
Since I am only notified during an initial install, I do not know
how these sites have subsequently tweaked their setup -- in my own
experience, the initial install rarely resembles the finished
product once all the various options have been appropriately
tailored. Therefore, this trend data is probably suspect.

I have been surprised by the global appeal that the software seems to
have; the diverse user base for each release after only a few months of 
availability is a testament to the power of the Internet. Here's a 
domain breakdown of known sites (based on the census data from
version 1.2.0 and above).
<P>
NOTE: These are sites that have installed <I>MajorCool</I> <U>and</U> 
been willing to admit it; there's no telling how many installations 
are really out there. Also, these reflect new installs only;
upgrades from previously installed versions are not announced:
