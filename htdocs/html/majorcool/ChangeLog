1.3.2
Wed Nov 25 16:39:01 PST 1998	Bill Houle (bhoule@sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Added REJECT action to Approval Queue. Posting will be returned
	  to the original sender, no specific explanation given. (It is up
	  to the moderator to add specifics via Message-Edit prior to 
	  rejecting.)

	* Added Message-Edit feature to Approval Queue. Editing large
	  (multi-Meg) files is not pretty due to browser memory
	  constraints, so your mileage may vary.

	* Scoping error of $members in send_who_form prevented editing
	  of subscriber list for Perl v5.004 users.
	  Vadim Chekan <vadim@gc.lviv.ua>

	* Treatment of list.passwd files was made more consistent with
	  Majordomo. A 'passwd' attempt is deferred to a 'newconfig'
	  _only_ if the master passwd file technique is detected (ie,
	  a read-only passwd file). This change allows a .passwd
	  file to be created when there is none pre-existing, rather
	  than always deferring to 'newconfig'. Added bonus is that
	  read-only is the key factor, not the name "MASTER.PASSWD".

	* Global $bouncedir can be set in majordomo.cf (for Approval Queue).
	  If not set, bounces stored in archive area, else $TMPDIR.

1.3.1
Tue Sep  1 10:28:18 PDT 1998	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* All regexps (where possible) are hard-compiled for performance.
	  Noticed a 10% BROWSE speed improvement in a quick comparison
	  on my system [400+ lists].

	* Full-screen snapshots in docs/help pages.

	* Recognize 'web_access' keyword in order to provide access-
	  control of Web interface (BROWSE/MODIFY) on a per-list basis.
	  Malgosia Askanas <askanas@panix.com>

	* No single-quotes allowed when calling mj_create_list.

	* RENAME mode & mj_rename_list contrib/ script added.

	* Exact-Match modifier for the "Find" browse option.

	* is_subscribed no longer locks a list for member test. Faster.
	  Lufan Chen <lchen@Rational.Com>

	* Domain-identify the Approved message of Web-based approvals.
	  Manar Hussain <manar@ivision.co.uk>

	* Email registration shows actual system class/config.

	* $debug flag in cf file for test toggling.

1.3.0
Fri Mar 27 17:00:02 PST 1998	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Threw some screen capture images into the usage/help file.

	* Added 'QuickView' mode for faster browsing (minus any global
	  sub/unsub capabilities). Individual sub/unsubs can be done
	  at the List Details level. The 'QuickView' mode is most useful
	  when quick access to a list-of-lists is needed without the
	  overhead of subscriber tests (eg, great for an "All"
	  quickie or for list owners using the "My Owned" search in
	  preparation for applying config changes to each).

	* Passed $module to BROWSE listname drill-down so that
	  'Help' came up in proper context.

	* Radio buttons on BROWSE and MODIFY main page now affected
	  by script args. Allows functions to be preset by URL.

	* mj_build_aliases merged with changes from the version by
	  Ricardo Marek. Added '@' file support and fixed the
	  create/delete scripts to invoke mj_build automatically if
	  found.

	* Added $opt_scansteps and more informative/engaging "please
	  wait" screen. On a slow server with lots of lists, some feedback
	  was needed to know that processing was truly occurring [and
	  to prevent the client from timing out].
	  (Requires $opt_multipart to be set.)

	* RESTART now restarts at current module rather than default
	  entry-point start.

	* 'module' variable was not set properly in footer for "context-
	  sensitive help" to work as expected.

	* Changed subsystem class of "owner" to "config" just to not be
	  "different". Sync'ed other subsytem names in patch sent to
	  majordomo-users.

	* Use lopen/close cooperative locking at all times (even if it
	  is just for simple reading/parsing.

	* Configuration Options keyword view based on subsystem (plus 
	  "all","basic"). Uses Javascript for auto-select on menu change.
	  Also eliminates the need for GenConfAll preference, giving more 
	  future cookie 'breathing room'.

	* Added date_info/_intro indicator on edit screens.

	* Turned on main'abort overload.

	* Approval Queue implemented. Resend will store BOUNCEd posts
	  on the server, where MajorCool can approve via the Web.
	  Mail-based approval still supported. (Requires patch applied
	  to Majordomo, available in contrib/.)

	* Support for 1.94 'intro' files.

	* Added a 'nn of total lists' display to the BROWSE results.

	* CSS font family quoted with ' instead of ". NN4 reported a
	  weird and sporadic JavaScript quoting error (even though the
	  quotes were balanced and the CSS and Javascript sections were
	  unrelated). Still don't know why it did what it did, but the 
	  quoting change seemed to fix it.

	* "Remote" mode for one-shot subscribe (or unsubscribe, who,
	  info) actions on non-MajorCool Web pages. Now a button can
	  be embedded to access some MajorCool functions indirectly.

	* Won't give MODIFY 'backdoor' button when BROWSE info/who
	  access is private or untrusted.

	* Type-checking added to domain-smtp's query for A records.
	  (Igor S. Livshits <igorl@uiuc.edu>)

1.2.0
Wed Dec 24 15:21:32 PST 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Reached the 20-Cookie limit for Prefs, so time for some
	  trimming. Collapsed BROWSE/MODIFY ListSort prefs into single
	  General pref to allow additional StyleSheet control.

	* "domain-smtp" siteaddr function added -- same as "domain", but
	  validates local addresses via DNS/SMTP lookup.
	  (Igor S. Livshits <igorl@uiuc.edu>)

	* CSS1 Style Sheets used for Font Face/Size tweaking (in lieu of
	  partially functional HTML <BASEFONT> tag).

	* mkdigest action available in MODIFY if list name matches -digest.

	* Configure to notify author of install success. Curiosity got 
	  the better of me. Completely optional of course.

	* Preferences were significantly reorganized to follow the
	  BROWSE/MODIFY/etc module model. The relationship to
	  earlier titles (Info Options, Config Options, etc) was
	  difficult for novices to comprehend. Tried to support
	  backwards compatibility for all the Cookies as best I
	  could. Hope it doesn't cause much trouble.

	* Show nested lists as BROWSE links if desired, or in bold
	  by default. Numbering option also added. (BROWSE mode only)

	* JavaScript 'balloon help' for the button-bar mouseOvers.
	  Implemented as a window.open for basic JavaScript clients.
	  Because the lack of onMouseOut support in MSIE3 can make
	  the popping windows a very annoying distraction, this
	  particular feature is optional above and beyond the generic
	  JavaScript support. Possible ToDo: an event-positioned CSS
	  Layer instead of a Window pop.

	* Leverage Majordomo set_log()/log() for logging actions.
	  All View/Form actions are logged to the Majordomo logfile.
	  The "host" is the Web server; the "process" is the CGI
	  name. Log messages will indicate the calling module involved
	  (BROWSE, MODIFY, CREATE, DELETE), and the "address" field will
	  contain the host/IP of the client. 'Change' actions are
	  not logged since they will be trapped by Majordomo itself
	  upon submission. Log entries will not break current
	  logsummary.pl reporting; a new MajorCool-aware logsummary.pl
	  is provided in contrib/.

	* Fix Configure override of /icons & /cgi-bin URLs.
	  (Igor S. Livshits <igorl@uiuc.edu>)

1.1.2
Fri Nov  7 18:46:42 PST 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* $list_create/delete commands added to config setup.
	  (Igor S. Livshits <igorl@uiuc.edu>)
	  
	* URL scheme is configurable to account for https/shttp.

	* Removed extraneous newline from all timestamp displays.

	* "Robots" META tag inserted in all HTML documents to
	  prevent Internet Spiders/WebCrawlers from indexing
	  installed copies, thus appearing to be a mirror of the
	  primary site. Also added optional Robot control to CGI
	  itself.

	* COOL_CACHE moved to cf file for same-dir support of
	  virtual servers. Changed Pragma $cache var to $http_cache
	  to avoid naming conflicts.

	* Added a FAQ section to the Docs (in support.htm).

	* Alpha-sort who list if no by_siteaddr defined.
	  (Joe Hartley <jh@metheny.brainiac.com>)

	* Details screen pulls list-owner from cache only if field
	  is defined. Defaults to owner-list in base configuration.
	  (Rick Perry <perry@news.ee.vill.edu>)

	* majordomo_deferred()/$opt_cmdverify for the ultra-paranoid 
	  or those interested in teaching users Majordomo syntax.
	  Rather than performing any actions directly, MajorCool
	  will construct the equivalent commands and send them to
	  the user so that they can do the actual mailing.

	* $opt_subverify is a slightly less comprehensive version of
	  $opt_cmdverify. Only requests to subscribe or unsubscribe
	  will be converted to commands and mailed back to the user.
	  The advantage here is that Web users cannot forge any
	  subscriptions.

	* Added 'Append' mode as an alternative workaround for
	  editing large lists.

	* Removed logging of REMOTE_ADDR if REMOTE_HOST is also an
	  IP address. (REMOTE_HOST always drops down to REMOTE_ADDR
	  if reverse lookup is not possible, so there is no chance
	  of not logging any details.) This will make for a shorter
	  header line in the redundant case.

	* UserID/GroupID ownership of files made configurable during
	  installation. Removed root install restriction. Made more
	  forgiving for a "virtual server" setup typical for some Web
	  hosting services. (Mark Rauterkus <mrauterkus@sportsurf.net>)

1.1.1
Mon Sep 15 20:24:32 PDT 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* On-line help added (based on auto-extract from existing Docs).

	* Changed is_advertised to handle 1.94 "extended" RE
	  modifiers (ie, '/re/i'). Also fixed adv vs noadv typo.

	* Non-regexp address comparisons now use Majordomo's
	  &addr_match function. No partial or $mungedomain support
	  yet.

	* Fixes to "domain" siteaddr function. (Steve Snodgrass
	  <ssnodgra@fore.com>)

1.1.0
Thu Jul 31 12:54:27 PDT 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Better Cache contents handling in cases where it is out of
	  sync with $listdir -- eg, list is deleted from system but
	  Cache not yet updated (Rick Perry <perry@news.ee.vill.edu>).

	* Configure changed to support multiple Cache files in
	  conjunction with multiple cf files (only if BROWSE mode
	  enabled).

	* Added subset-edit feature and corresponding ListMaxSize
	  preference to deal with browser TextArea limits. Now
	  supports large lists.

	* Recoded CGI "exec" invocation to use @args list rather than
	  command line, thus bypassing /bin/sh interpretation: safer
	  and execs faster (Rick Perry <perry@news.ee.vill.edu>).

	* Eliminated null Cookie value which caused header problems
	  on Netscape server (Ricardo Marek <ricky@ornet.co.il>)

	* "exit" replaced by "return" for private who/info functions.
	  (Christina Perry <cmp@ece.vill.edu>)

	* JavaScript browser-detect for MouseOver support removed in
	  favor of Image object test (trick courtesy of Jeff Foust
	  <jfoust@mit.edu>).

	* The siteaddr() function is now the one-and-only producer
	  of the ADDRESS and PATTERN variables. These parameters can
	  no longer be passed in the URL, greatly reducing the risk
	  of spoofing invalid data.

	* Regexp component of siteaddr() made optional. If not
	  supplied, subscription check is straight address compare.
	  This eliminates potential for abuse via the "simple"
	  siteaddr function, which does not require regexp comparisons
	  anyway. Mapping functions that *do* utilize the regexp
	  feature (eg ncr-rolo, LDAP, etc) can continue to do so
	  without modification. Any use of regexps, however, should
	  be done with the utmost care to ensure that no compromise
	  is possible.

	* Configure fixed to not ask siteaddr() questions if BROWSE
	  module is not configured.

	* List search function added: finds all lists matching
	  specified search string.

	* Security hole discovered by Rick Perry <perry@news.ee.vill.edu>
	  which allowed any arbitrary Majordomo file (eg list.config)
	  to be treated as a list. Tighter list checks implemented.

	* Preferences now saves state. After updating, it will
	  return to the screen prior to calling Prefs.

	* SendConfigByEmail made site-optional. Also made saving
	  config file comments (ie, writeconfig) optional. Both
	  suggested by Roman Richardson (Roman.Richardson@state.mn.us).

	* New images! [Courtesy of Robin.Cooper.Wood@SanDiegoCA.NCR.COM]
	  Extensive graphics support, including optional SUBMIT buttons.

	* Went JavaScript-crazy with optional MouseOvers, status bar
	  changes, and form.element onFocus bells & whistles.

	* MenuMode to provide more intuitive interface. Optional via
	  preferences, of course. Layout reorg favors centering tables
	  and text. Modules are 'browse', 'modify', 'create', 'delete',
	  and 'prefs'. All but 'prefs' are optional as specified in
	  the config file.

	* Supports multiple MajorCool cf files to allow multiple
	  program instances and provide additional flexibility for
	  virtual server users. Displays server and current config
	  name onscreen. 
	  
	  NOTE: Use of $hidden_admin for split user/admin personality
	  has been removed in favor of using separate config files
	  with module control.

	  NOTE: New default Configure output name is "default.sh".

	* Potential security hole in mj_key_cache was corrected
	  (again) thanks to the folks at FootHill De Anza College
	  (ash@dasb.fhda.edu). This was fixed (though not as well)
	  in an earlier release that seems to have been lost. Also 
	  lost was an earlier patch for the unsubscribe_policy 
	  attribute in the Cache file. Still don't know why those 
	  fixes fell through the cracks. Sorry!

	  NOTE: Cache file field separator changed to non-printable 
	  ^G to avoid conflicts with '#' in list description.

	* Semi-context-sensitive Help file access. The current module
	  name is passed as an anchor to the Help document. The Help
	  document itself is sparse, but the framework is a
	  beginning.

	* Added "Home" button and "sitehome" config to return to
	  default home page.

	* Use of owner-list is more universal; some sites may not
	  have implemented the optional list-owner alias. Suggested by
	  Gunnar Helliesen <gunnar@bitcon.no>.

	* Added list-address on Details page.

	* Karsten Mueller's regexp for the "simple" siteaddr caused
	  problems for many sites that did not use that addr format. 
	  Left it in as a comment for those who want to turn it on.
	  Added simpler lefthand/righthand address check in its place.

	* admin_passwd was not getting changed properly when the
	  "double-entry" Change Password form was used. (Identified
	  by Roman Richardson <Roman.Richardson@state.mn.us>)

	* 'intro' prompt in siteaddr renamed to 'browse' for
	  consistency with the new browse/modify/create/delete model.

	* Added list-deletion functionality (same as list-create).

	* Added use of "password" command to change passwords if
	  list.pass files are used. (Also detects Dave Wolfe's
	  MASTER.PASSWD technique and reverts to full config.)

	* Added support for absolute_file, absolute_dir, and
	  restrict_post config field types.

	* IMG dimensions added to improve display speeds. Images
	  have changed often, so calculations are performed on-the-fly.

	* Emptying config fields now properly saves them as empty
	  (rather than a no-op).

	* Configurable TMPDIR.

1.0.3
Thu May 15 14:05:28 PDT 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Added preference to switch between 'basic' admin keyword
	  edit (keyword list is defined in cf file) and edit of all
	  available keywords.

	* Added preference to word-wrap the list info edit box.
	  Wrapping appears to work onscreen, but file is saved
	  unwrapped, so this is not a complete feature implementation.

	* Changed COOKIE name from SortedList to ListSorted to pave
	  the way for category grouping. (Tried to ensure backwards
	  compatibility.)

	* Reduce/eliminate dependency on 'owner' keyword. If keyword
	  not implmented (as opposed to implemented but unset), then
	  submit_as address is $list-owner@$whereami.

	  Functions such as 'show owned lists' and 'show owner-less
	  lists' are unavailable if the owner addition is not
	  implemented.

	* Restored member count data on list config screen. (Removed
	  during addition of View/Edit List & Info FORM buttons.)

	  Added list info filesize complement.

	* Format config help via html_encode().

	* Made "Pragma: no-cache" a preference to allow each user to
	  determine whether to allow caching of pages.

1.0.2
Thu Apr  3 00:56:29 PST 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* $hidden_admin support moved all the way into the command
	  processing level. This removes any backdoor access to user vs.
	  admin functions that the site owner may deem unwanted.

	* Use &valid_passwd() Majordomo function rather than own comparison.
	  This allows for support of list.pass (even though MajorCool will
	  not support the creation of the file directly). Idea prompted by
	  Matthew O'Brien <matthew@digiweb.com.au>.

	* &is_subscribed() now uses Majordomo's ParseAddrs() to remove
	  RFC822 comments from addresses before comparison. This eliminates
	  the need to construct a perfect siteaddr regexp to match commented 
	  addresses. (Thanks to Dave Wolfe for showing me the hazards of 
	  using \b to match comment boundaries.)

	  is_subscribed() also now matches all possible subscribed addresses
	  rather than stopping after the first hit.

	* Begin implementation of button-based access to list subfunctions
	  (such as View/Edit List or Info).

	* Removed $last_sent, $log_suffix in config. Bogus data for most
	  sites anyway.

1.0.1
Thu Mar 20 00:28:04 PST 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* COOKIE-based preferences for config field help, who
	  sorting, etc.

	* Regexp address syntax check implemented in "simple" siteaddr
	  from Karsten Mueller <karsten@zora.nadir.org>. (Why doesn't
	  Majordomo's valid_addr() do this?!?)

	* Additions for 1.94 who_access and info_access (as started
	  by Karsten Mueller <karsten@zora.nadir.org>).

	* show_config: html_encode() only on non-null subscribed-as
	  field. (Jean-Michel Augusto <jma@acri.fr>)

	* Spurious "$private_who" non-existent variable removed.

1.0 (OFFICIAL RELEASE)
Mon Feb 24 18:01:33 PST 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Escape special HTML characters for subscribed-as address values
	  ("Dave A. Roger" <daroger@tisc.com>).

	* List diff now uses 'state' file to eliminate contention/sync
	  problems. Diffs will be against membership at the time of edit,
	  independent of subsequent sub/unsubs applied via other instances.

	* 'Configure' rewrite for sake of portability (spurred by problem
	  with install on FreeBSD, "Dave A. Roger" <daroger@tisc.com>).

	* 'subscribe' now uses the preferred addr of the mail headers.

	* &set_mailer($bounce_mailer) for 1.94.1. <daroger@tisc.com>

	* "Pragma: no-cache" to disable page caching. <daroger@tisc.com>
	  [Not 100% convinced this is needed/desirable....]

1.0 PRE 13
Tue Feb  4 01:08:46 PST 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* List diff implemented to replace 'newwho' functionality!

	* Check for list existence before any get_config() to avoid leaving
	  config file droppings on incorrect list names.

	* All config variable changes prefixed by cf_ to avoid future
	  collision with non-config arguments.

	* Text action commands rather than numeric.

1.0 PRE 12
Mon Jan 20 22:14:58 PST 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Added 'trust_identity' global config to allow disbelief of user
	  addresses when accessing private_ functions. See $private_msg.

	* 'approve sub/unsub' sends mail with submit_as (owner) rather than
	  target user.

	* do_sub_unsub() loop & variable cleanup.

1.0 PRE 11
Tue Jan 14 16:58:19 PST 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Support for string_array values in config screen! 
	
	* Regexp-based method in do_newconfig() rewritten to use get_config()
	  API.

	* Datestamp for 'info' file displayed but removed from editable text
	  portion of 'newinfo' screen.

	* $sitehelp no longer requires DOCUMENT_ROOT.

1.0 PRE 10
Tue Jan  7 15:08:41 PST 1997	Tom Moore <tm131507@rpc1220.DaytonOH.NCR.COM>.

	* Added url_encode() to avoid embedded space problems in address
	  and pattern URL args.

	* ncr-ldap X.500 query siteaddr contributed.

	* Fixes for siteaddr/ncr-rolo and Configure siteaddr dependencies.

1.0 PRE 9
Mon Jan  6 12:00:12 PST 1997	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Fully-qualified default $list-owner in mailto: URL of List Detail 
	  screen.

	* Use \001 as change_config() regexp separator character to avoid 
	  substitution probs.

	* Perl5 [] artifact broke REMOTE_ADDR logging. Fixed.

	* Fixed HTML <> display for RFC822 address comments in "who" output:
	  "real name <address>".

	* Order of config field edit now *really* determined by @admin_keywords.
	  No fib this time.

	* Braindead error in regexp mangling for change_config introduced by
	  Perl5 and earlier cleanup.

	* Added 'show unsubscribed lists'.

1.0 PRE 8
Fri Dec 20 16:55:14 PST 1996	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Added $list_request_cmd New-list Request automation and contrib code
	  as mj_create_list. Can now request & recieve new lists on the fly.

	* Misc Perl5 fixes for get_who/get_list (join('',...)

1.0 PRE 7
Fri Dec 13 13:05:10 PST 1996	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Makefile replaced by Configure script (including support for siteaddr
	  files) thanks to Tom Moore <tm131507@rpc1220.DaytonOH.NCR.COM>!

	* Added New-list request form (sends mail to Majordomo-owner).

	* Tighter access control (is_subscribed test added to show_who; 
	  list-owner undisclosed on details screen if private_who enabled).

	* Added "Show all unconfigured lists".

1.0 PRE 6
Wed Dec 11 19:58:32 PST 1996	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* SysV Makefile fixes from Tom Moore <tm131507@rpc1220.DaytonOH.NCR.COM>.

	* Added "Show all lists that I own" feature.

	* Added linkage from list-user view to list-administration (password
	  protected, of course).

	* Enabled quicker access to list membership administration by placing menu
	  selection side-by-side with configuration file choice at the top level.

	* Changed `eval $cf` to "require". With cf syntax error, Perl died
	  silently on the eval and you never got the die() error!

1.0 PRE 5
Tue Dec 10 20:38:28 PST 1996	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Makefile-based installation.

	* Perl5 compatibility courtesy of Marisa Giancarla <marisa@andromedia.com>.

	* Reliance on NCSA-ish README.html changed to genuine index file
	  (inspired by comments from Shane Wilson <shane@centre.edu>).

1.0 PRE 4
Tue Nov  5 16:44:23 PST 1996	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Re-organized & commented config file.

1.0 PRE 3
Tue Oct  1 08:57:21 PDT 1996	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Moved @admin_keyword array into cf file for localized modifications.

	* Changed mj_www_interface script name to majorcool.pl.

1.0 PRE 2
Wed Aug 21 14:16:53 PDT 1996	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Rewrote arg-parsing to correctly use CONTENT_LENGTH; problem
	  identified by Mike Alleman <lma@mpd.tandem.com>.

1.0 PRE 0
Thu Jun 27 11:01:05 PDT 1996	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Added configurable separation of admin and user forms:

	  If enabled, only user subscription form presented by default.
	  Admin form presented only if CGI name matches setting. When
	  disabled, both forms are visible on the same opening screen.

Thu May  2 14:55:31 PDT 1996	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Turned list.last handling into configurable log suffix.

	* Added "unsubscribe" capability to APPROVAL form.

Fri Apr 19 21:48:58 PDT 1996	Bill Houle (bhoule@www.sandiegoca.ncr.com)

	* Approval form+function for individual subscriber addition: 

	  Bypasses "problem" with 'newwho' routine, which does not
	  notify new list members per the usual Majordomo workflow.

	* Externalized the address sorting routine: 

	  Member-sort routine is equally tied to address formats 
	  defined in "siteaddr" lookup functions, so it made sense to
