<A NAME="FUTURE">
<H2>Future Direction</H2>
</A>

<P><I>MajorCool</I> is by no means complete. There are plenty of things to
fix and/or improve. Alas, these will not be addressed in the 1.x series,
as focus has now shifted to supporting the future <I>Majordomo</I>
2.0 product.

<A NAME="CONCERNS">
<H3>Design Concerns</H3>
</A>

<UL>
<LI><B>Authentication</B> -- Using the Web to augment a mail-based
system is always problematic. Barring the use of <I>htpasswd</I> or
other server-based authentication, there is no way to trust that the
user is whom [s]he says [s]he is. For <I>MajorCool</I>, a decision was
made to "bite the bullet" and trust that the end-user can correctly
specify his/her e-mail address (or name). <CODE>$trust_identity</CODE>
was implemented to partially address the issue. However, this still
leaves the door open for tampering with list subscriptions under a
false name. In order to minimize this risk, the <I>httpd</I>
<B>REMOTE_HOST</B> and <B>REMOTE_ADDRESS</B> CGI variables are sent as
part of address comments in the simulated e-mail header. Thus,
<I>Majordomo</I> maintains an accurate Log of who submitted Web
requests. If authentication can be improved in any way, it can only
serve the users better.

<P>
<LI><B>Results Feedback</B> -- The single biggest limitation of the
chosen design is the fact that <I>Majordomo</I> still sends final
results of "change" actions via e-mail. Although <I>MajorCool</I> does
a majority of the front-end work interactively, the interpretation of 
the <I>Majordomo</I> modify actions is not possible and the user must
instead watch for e-mail confirmation.  An API interface to 
<I>Majordomo</I> would be monumentally useful, allowing actions to be 
performed with the results returned as a function call return rather 
than assuming e-mail.

<P>
<LI><B>Performance</B> -- Because <I>Majordomo</I> is ultimately used
to perform any actual work for list or configuration changes, the
<I>MajorCool</I> app is at the mercy of how fast <I>Majordomo</I> can
process the submitted commands. Given this and the above Feedback
limitation, it may be more appropriate to simply hand off the tasks to
<I>Majordomo</I> as a background process and not have <I>MajorCool</I>
wait for command completion as it currently does. In other words, is
the 'trace' output really necessary?

</UL>

<A NAME="TODO">
<H3>Bugs/Misfeatures/ToDo</H3>
</A>

<UL>
<LI><B>Document returns no data.</B> Some users have reported that
BROWSE mode in 1.3.x is resulting in a "Document returns no data"
output. I am unable to reproduce this error; it is probably a Perl
run-time (as opposed to syntax) error. The fact that it is a null
document rather than a 500 HTTP response indicates that the HTTP
header is being transmitted before the script ends prematurely.
However, there has yet to be an error indicated in the Web server 
logs. I suspect this is memory-related, but I cannot be sure. If 
you are experiencing this behavior, any system info (Perl version, 
Web server version, OS, memory, etc) you can provide might help to
identify common traits.

<P>
<LI><B>Word-wrap of the <CODE>info</CODE> file.</B> Despite the use
of <CODE>WRAP=PHYSICAL</CODE> and the Preferences setting to control
it, wrapping of the file is not working correctly.

<P>
<LI><B>Archive list &amp; file <CODE>get</CODE> interface.</B> The next
logical step would be to provide access to <I>Majordomo</I> list archives,
possibly even augmented by HTML formatting via tools such as
<A HREF="http://www.eit.com/software/hypermail/">HyperMail</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/ehood/mhonarc.html">MHonArc</A>.

<P>
<LI><B>Bypass the Key Cache.</B> The use of the key cache was
necessitated by the inherent slowness of the <CODE>get_config()</CODE>
API call when plodding through all lists that the server offers.
When/if <I>Majordomo</I> moves to a more efficient file interface, we
will be able to dump the caching, thus eliminating an extra
installation step.

<P>
<LI><B>More complete <CODE>is_advertised()</CODE> address matching.</B> 
The <CODE>is_advertised()</CODE> function should probably match against
address patterns rather than primary address. But this would involve
comparing RE's to RE's, and I was too lazy to investigate how.

<P>
<LI><B>Cross-pollinate <CODE>siteaddr()</CODE> and <CODE>sort
by_siteaddr</CODE>.</B> I think having some address
 equivalency functions would be valuable additions to
<I>Majordomo</I>.

<P>
<LI><B><CODE>htmlinfo/newhtmlinfo</CODE>.</B> Add an <CODE>html</CODE>
command to <I>Majordomo</I> to support an HTML-ized version of the
<CODE>info</CODE> as <CODE>$list.html</CODE>. The HTML file can then 
be displayed by <I>MajorCool</I> if present.
