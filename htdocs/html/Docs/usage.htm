<!--BEGIN INTRO-->

<P><I>MajorCool</I> is a Web interface to the <I>Majordomo</I>
mailing list management tool. Whereas <I>Majordomo</I> is a rather
unforgiving command-driven application that utilizes e-mail for 
effecting changes, <I>MajorCool</I> adds a Web-based front-end
to provide a user-friendly interface to list manager operations.

<P>Rather than focusing on command syntax, <I>MajorCool</I> is
designed around the practical activities of mailing list access
such as browsing, modifying, creating, renaming, and deleting.

<UL>
<LI>"Browsing" is an end-user activity, allowing users to examine
lists and change their subscriptions.
<LI>"Modifying" is a list-owner function, enabling users to change the
behavior of the lists that they maintain.
<LI>"Creating", "Renaming", and "Deleting" are site-maintenance actions
for adding new lists, changing list names, or deleting those no longer 
in use.
</UL>

<P>Each of these modes are optional, since the site administrator
may elect to disable support for certain modules. They are accessed
through the URL that <I>MajorCool</I> was installed as --
<CODE><A HREF="/cgi-bin/majordomo">/cgi-bin/majordomo</A></CODE> by
default. In addition, multiple installations of <I>MajorCool</I> can
be supported on the same system, each with its own unique URL. For
instance, it is not uncommon to see the BROWSE and MODIFY modules 
split into separate <I>MajorCool</I> installations. (If some actions 
are unavailable in your instance of <I>MajorCool</I>, check with your
site administrator to see if there might be alternative URLs
available.)

<P>The selection of actions is made from a menu-based interface
(with the desired modules chosen via a button-bar), or full-screen with
all actions visible on the main page. 
<IMG SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_menu.gif" ALT="Screen Capture: ButtonBar Menu"
  WIDTH="353" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="right" BORDER=1 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
The display of menu- vs. full-screen is defined by a per-user Preferences
setting. Since the menu interface is the default presentation, all 
references to <I>MajorCool</I> actions in this guide will be shown 
relative to menu mode.
Pressing a menu button will take you to the appropriate module;
the current module is indicated by a "depressed" (gray) button.
What follows is a description of each available mode. 

<!--END INTRO-->
<!--BEGIN BROWSE-->

<A NAME="BROWSE">
<H3>
  <IMG SRC="../icons/mc_browse_banner.gif" ALT="[BROWSE]" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
  <A HREF="../icons/mc_scrncap_full_browse1.gif"><IMG
    SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_mini_browse1.gif" 
    ALT="[Thumbnail]" ALIGN=MIDDLE BORDER=0></A>
  <A HREF="../icons/mc_scrncap_full_browse2.gif"><IMG
    SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_mini_browse2.gif" 
    ALT="[Thumbnail]" ALIGN=MIDDLE BORDER=0></A>
  <A HREF="../icons/mc_scrncap_full_browse3.gif"><IMG
    SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_mini_browse3.gif" 
    ALT="[Thumbnail]" ALIGN=MIDDLE BORDER=0></A>
</H3>
</A>

<P>BROWSE mode is the act of viewing list information and/or changing
subscription status to the lists served by <I>Majordomo</I>. In
order for the browsing process to begin, the user is first queried 
for his/her e-mail address. The user also has the option at this 
time to limit the browsing to:

<UL>
<LI>lists currently subscribed to by the user
<LI>lists currently unsubscribed to by the user
<LI>list names or descriptions matching a search string
<LI>all available lists on the server
</UL>

<P>To say that the user is prompted for an e-mail address may be an
over-simplification, depending upon the installation. Although an
e-mail address is required, how that address information is obtained 
is ultimately up to the site administrator.
<IMG SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_browse.gif" ALT="Screen Capture: Browsing"
  WIDTH="148" HEIGHT="129" ALIGN="right" BORDER=1 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
<I>MajorCool</I> has the ability to query external address mapping
functions via it's <CODE>siteaddr()</CODE> interface, so it may be that
a particular site prompts instead for a username, letting the defined
mapping function produce a valid e-mail address in return.

<P>When the "go" button is pressed, the e-mail address (or other
appropriate value) is processed by the defined <CODE>siteaddr()</CODE>
function to produce an address search string. This will be used to
compare against the addresses in the <I>Majordomo</I> lists. A set 
of valid list-names will be displayed as a result. Since a
<CODE>siteaddr()</CODE> function can produce an address pattern as
well as a fixed string, the matching method allows <I>MajorCool</I> 
to catch multiple addresses that a user might be subscribed under
rather than just a single address as is typical for <I>Majordomo</I>.

<P>If "QuickView Mode" is selected prior to invoking the BROWSE,
list subscription tests will be disabled, thus speeding access to
the list overview at the cost of disabling subscription changes at
the global list level. Even when in QuickView mode, the user will 
still have the ability to alter subscription choices at each 
individual List Detail view.

<H4>Subscribe/Unsubscribe Screen</H4>

<P>If the "Find" option is used with "Exact Match" enabled, and
assuming such a list exists, the user is taken directly to the List
Details screen. In all other cases,
<IMG SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_sub.gif" ALT="Screen Capture: Subscribe Checkbox"
  WIDTH="177" HEIGHT="64" ALIGN="right" BORDER=1 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
the result of a BROWSE action is to display a set of list names
(matching the selected criteria) as a table of checkboxes, list names,
and list descriptions.  The list names are hyperlinked to allow a
drill-down to additional list details.

<P>After modifying subscription selections via checkbox, the user
applies the changes and the submission is compared against the last
known subscription selections. Any changes will be converted into the
appropriate <I>Majordomo</I> '<CODE>subscribe</CODE>' or
'<CODE>unsubscribe</CODE>' commands using the user's "primary 
address" (as defined by the <CODE>siteaddr()</CODE> results).

<P>If subscription tests were disabled via the "QuickView" option,
there will be no checkboxes on this screen to indicate membership or
allow the user to toggle subscriptions. Subscription changes,
however, are available at the Details view for each list.

<H4>List Details</H4>

<P>Drill-down to a particular list shows additional list information
such as the list-owner address, access to the list's <CODE>info</CODE>
and <CODE>intro</CODE> files, list membership, and other subscriber
details. Depending on the security restrictions of the browsed list and
how much the site administrator "trusts" its users, selected list details
will either be presented onscreen or returned to the user via e-mail.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_toggle.gif" ALT="Screen Capture: Subscribe Toggle"
  WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="51" ALIGN="right" BORDER=1 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
A button is available in the Detail view to toggle subscription
status, allowing the user to subscribe using the primary address or
unsubscribe the current subscribed-as address.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_backdoor.gif" ALT="Screen Capture: Modify Access"
  WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="50" ALIGN="right" BORDER=1 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
If the user browsing the the list has knowledge of the admin
password, the Details screen also provides an entry-point into the 
MODIFY mode for the displayed list.

<P>When viewing list subscribers, if the list contains other lists as
members ("nested lists") the entries will be shown in bold or as
hyperlinks, depending upon current preference settings. If linked, 
further drill-down will access the detail or subscriber screen for that
nested list (also controlled by preferences).

<!--END BROWSE-->
<!--BEGIN MODIFY-->

</H3>
</A>

<P>The MODIFY module provides access to the list-manager functions
for a selected list. The user is prompted for a list name (via typed
entry or pull-down menu) and the list password. The list administrator 
has the option of choosing to modify the:

<UL>
<LI>list configuration options
<LI>list subscribers
<LI>list info file
<LI>list intro file
<LI>list approval queue
</UL>

<P>When the "go" button is pressed, the password is validated and,
if successful, the user is given access to one of the following list
configuration functions:

<H4>Configuration Options</H4>

<P>
<IMG SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_confkey.gif" ALT="Screen Capture: Config Entry"
  WIDTH="286" HEIGHT="116" ALIGN="right" BORDER=1 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
From the CONFIGURATION OPTIONS screen, administrators can change
configuration items such as list description, subscription policy,
approve password, and much more. HTML buttons and other elements are
used to simplify configuration for the beginner. <I>Majordomo</I>
configuration option keyword entries are heavily commented, and
<I>MajorCool</I> provides onscreen display of this field-level "help".

<P>
<IMG SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_keywords.gif" ALT="Screen Capture: Keyword Scope"
  WIDTH="203" HEIGHT="156" ALIGN="right" BORDER=1 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
Admins can access a simplified set
of list config keywords (defined by the site owner), the entire
set of <I>Majordomo</I> keywords, or only those pertaining to a
specific subsystem.

<P>Although it is not the intent of this guide to
provide a <I>Majordomo</I> tutorial, here are some list-management
concepts to be aware of when configuring your list. Options in the
<I>Majordomo</I> list configuration file control behaviors such as:

<!-- This section based loosely on previous work from Walt Haas. -->
<!-- http://medstat.med.utah.edu/medstat_ops/ Operations Manual -->

<UL>

<LI><U><I>Majordomo</I> Access Control</U>

<DL>
<DT><B>Subscriber Control</B>
<DD>List owners have the ability to define who may subscribe or
unsubscribe to their lists. Options range from wide-open (allowing
anyone to join) to closed (where any attempt requires your
approval).<P>

<DT><B>User Access</B>
<DD>Various areas of a list configuration can be restricted from
public view. Access to details such as list membership and
<CODE>info</CODE> files can be disabled, granted only to list members, 
or completely unrestricted. List names can even be hidden from view 
based on the originating address.<P>

<DT><B>Passwords</B>
<DD>The administrator password controls who has the ability to alter
list characteristics. Anyone with knowledge of this password can
make configuration changes. The approval password overrides moderation
and other checks &amp; balances when sending mail to a list. Anyone with
knowledge of this password can post freely to the list.<P>
</DL>

<LI><U>Posting Checks &amp; Balances</U>

<DL>
<DT><B>Moderation</B>
<DD>The practice of having one or more persons (the moderators) read
and approve each message addressed to the list rather than allowing
messages to pass freely. Posting is only allowed for those who know
the password. This allows the moderator(s) to protect the subscribers
from accidental or inappropriate messages.<P>

<DT><B>Restrict Post</B>
<DD>Similar to moderation, restricted posting limits who can send
mail to a list. Posting is only allowed for those whose originating
address matches the addresses in one or more "restrict_post" lists.
A typical configuration might be to set the "restrict_post" list to 
the list itself in order to restrict posting to list members only. 
This prevents non-subscribers from interjecting into a forum.<P>

<DT><B>Administrivia Filtering</B>
<DD>Refers to a very limited form of moderation. The administrivia filter
is a subsystem that attempts to detect <I>Majordomo</I> commands or
requests that are intended for the list manager but are often sent
by accident to the entire list. When the administrivia filter is in
use, it examines each message addressed to the list for the presence
of certain trigger words (such as '<CODE>help</CODE>' or
'<CODE>unsubscribe</CODE>)' and forwards any such message to the
moderator for a decision as to whether the message is actually
intended for the list. Messages that do not trigger the administrivia
filter are sent directly to the list with no intervention.<P>

</DL>

<LI><U>Message Processing</U>

<DL>
<DT><B>Headers &amp; Footers</B>
<DD><I>Majordomo</I> can modify messages as they are being sent to
include new mail headers, message footers &amp; fronters, and
subject modifiers.<P>

<DT><B>Archiving</B> 
<DD>The practice of keeping old mail messages that were sent to the
list in a disk file for future reference. Archives are accessible
via the <I>Majordomo</I> '<CODE>index</CODE>' and '<CODE>get</CODE>'
commands.<P>

<DT><B>Digesting</B>
<DD>The process of combining multiple messages sent to the list into
a single mail message. Some people find it more convenient to receive
a single consolidated message than each of the messages individually.
Many lists have a regular and a <CODE>-digest</CODE> form, allowing
users to subscribe to whichever delivery method they prefer.<P>
</DL>

</UL>

<P>When changes are made to the config file and submitted, the update
is carried out by sending a '<CODE>newconfig</CODE>' command to
<I>Majordomo</I>.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_modify.gif" ALT="Screen Capture: Modify Other"
  WIDTH="290" HEIGHT="106" ALIGN="right" BORDER=1 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
Additional buttons are provided on the Options screen that will take
the administrator to the other areas that can be modified (e.g. the list
<CODE>intro</CODE> file or the list itself).

<H4>Subscriber Administration</H4>

<P>The SUBSCRIBER ADMINISTRATION screen allows the list admin 
to view and modify the members of the list. Any changes submitted 
are converted to the appropriate '<CODE>subscribe</CODE>' or 
'<CODE>unsubscribe</CODE>' command and issued to <I>Majordomo</I>
with the '<CODE>approve</CODE>' qualifier.

<H4>Info File</H4>

<P>The <CODE>$list.info</CODE> file is sent to all new subscribers, 
or returned by request via the '<CODE>info</CODE>' command. Presence
of a <CODE>$list.intro</CODE> file will override the use of the
<CODE>$list.info</CODE> in the new subscriber greeting.

<P>The INFO FILE page allows the list admin to view and modify
this <CODE>$list.info</CODE> file. If changes are submitted, a
'<CODE>newinfo</CODE>' command is issued to <I>Majordomo</I>.

<H4>Intro File</H4>

<P>The <CODE>$list.intro</CODE> file is sent to all new subscribers, 
or returned by request via the '<CODE>intro</CODE>' command. Presence
of a <CODE>$list.intro</CODE> file will override the use of the
<CODE>$list.info</CODE> in the new subscriber greeting.

<P>The INTRO FILE page allows the list admin to view and modify
the <CODE>$list.intro</CODE> file. If changes are submitted, a
'<CODE>newintro</CODE>' command is issued to <I>Majordomo</I>.

<H4>Approval Queue</H4>

<P>If the installed version of <I>Majordomo</I> supports it,
<I>MajorCool</I> will also provide an APPROVAL QUEUE option. The
"approval queue" is where <I>Majordomo</I> stores messages that were
sent to the list but require moderator approval before posting (e.g.
moderated lists, administrivia checks, etc).

<P>Normally, these messages are returned in their entirety to the
moderator, who must then manipulate mail headers prior to sending
the message back to the list. <I>MajorCool</I> eliminates the need
to play with e-mail and instead offers push-button approval via the
Web.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../icons/mc_scrncap_approval.gif" ALT="Screen Capture: Approval Queue"
  WIDTH="239" HEIGHT="114" ALIGN="right" BORDER=1 VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10>
Access to the approval queue off the main screen is via the
<CODE>admin_pass</CODE> or the <CODE>approve_pass</CODE> password
(this is the only operation that accepts the moderator password in
addition to that of the list owner). Examining the queue will show
all pending messages as identified by the sender, subject, date,
and message-id of the mail. 

<P>The administrator has the option to View or Edit the content of
the messages prior to taking action. Such actions include approving,
deleting, rejecting, or holding the message:

<UL>
<LI>The act of approving the message simply sends the mail on to the
list with the appropriate <CODE>Approved:</CODE> header line added. 
Approved messages are removed from the queue once processed.
<LI>Deleting a message from the queue removes the file; no message is
sent to the list, and no acknowledgement is returned to the sender.
<LI>Rejecting a message returns the message to the sender with a
list of possible reasons for rejection. If an explicit reason is
needed, the moderator should add via the Edit function.
<LI>A message left in the Hold state will remain pending in the queue 
until another actionable operation is selected.
</UL>

<P>When editing messages in the Approval Queue, it is important to
understand that the functionality is largely browser dependent.
Large files, when loaded into a browser window, can be a very
memory-intensive operation for the client.

<H4>Change List Password</H4>

<P>If the site administrator has so chosen, the changing of the
list-admin password can be moved to a "safer" double-entry method
in this form. This section is not present if the option is disabled.

<P>Normally, the password change is implemented as a config file
update via the '<CODE>newconfig</CODE>' command. However, if
<I>MajorCool</I> detects the presence of a legacy
<CODE>list.pass</CODE> file, the deprecated '<CODE>password</CODE>'
command is used instead. The exception to this is if <I>MajorCool</I>
detects the implementation of the "master password file" technique
of <CODE>list.pass</CODE> linked to a read-only
<CODE>MASTER.PASSWD</CODE>.

<H4>Initiating A Digest</H4>

<P>If the list is a digest, the owner is provided with a button to
create a digest -- combining all unsent messages into a digested
collection -- and sending that mail to all digest subscribers.

<H4>Send Full Config</H4>

<P>The final form available at the list configuration level is the
SEND FULL CONFIG BY EMAIL which simply issues a '<CODE>config</CODE>'
command to retrieve the current configuration file in the user's name.

<!--END MODIFY-->
<!--BEGIN CREATE-->

</H3>
</A>

<P>The CREATE form is provided to allow users and
administrators to request that a new <I>Majordomo</I> list be created.
The user is prompted for the list name, description, admin password,
and list owner address.  This request will be sent to the
<CODE>Majordomo-owner</CODE> address. Alternatively (depending on the
setting of <CODE>list_create_cmd</CODE>), the collected data can be
passed on to an external program for more flexible and automated
request processing.

<P>The list name should consist of alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9),
underscores (_), and hyphens (-). Only lowercase names are allowed,
since <I>sendmail</I> will convert any address to lowercase prior to
delivery.

<P>The list description is a one-line text phrase to help clarify the
purpose of the new list, since the character restrictions imposed
on list names can often make them appear quite cryptic.

<P>Every list must have a password associated with it. This password
controls access to the list maintenance functions. No one can make any
changes to the list (approving the addition/removal of members,
updating the configuration, etc) without knowing the password. Do
not pick obvious words, and if you must write it down, keep it in a
safe place.

<P>There must be an email address for the list owner. The list owner
is the person who will have the duties of controlling any aspects of
list operation which are not handled automatically. At the most
basic level, these duties will include dealing with errors and mail 
delivery failures. Depending upon the configuration of the list,
tasks may also include such actions as moderation and administrivia
filtering.
