<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:125%;">Installing Grouper</span><p>

To install Grouper, please do the following:

<ol>
<li>Decide where you want to put the Grouper scripts on your webserver, and create a new folder for them if necessary.<br>
	<b>Recommendations:</b>
	<ul>
	<li>We recommend that the folder be named "grouper".
		This will make it more likely that the setup assistant will be able to locate it automatically.
		If you are going to name it "grouper", you may create it by uploading the "grouper" folder from the installation archive and its contents (see next step).</li>
	<li>It is good security practice to install scripts like Grouper in a location that cannot be accessed directly by a web browser.
		For example, if your web folder is located at "/home/joe/public_html", a good location to install Grouper would be "/home/joe/grouper" rather than "/home/joe/public_html/grouper".
		<b>However, if you see an error message about "safe mode", you may need to install Grouper inside your web directory.</b></li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	</li>
<li>Upload all of the contents of the "grouper" folder from the installation archive to the location chosen in the previous step.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Upload groupersetup.php to your webserver (in a location where you'll be able to load it in your web browser).<br>
	<b>Recommendation:</b>
	For simplicity, we recommend uploading groupersetup.php to the web server root directory.
	For example, if your web directory is located at "/home/joe/public_html", upload it to there.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Load groupersetup.php in your web browser.
	For example, if you uploaded it to "/home/joe/public_html/groupersetup.php" and your website address is http://www.webhost.com/~joe/,
		load http://www.webhost.com/~joe/groupersetup.php in your web browser.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Follow the directions that are shown in that page.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>Once you have successfully completed setup, delete groupersetup.php and groupersetupinc.php from your server.<br />&nbsp;</li>
<li>You may also delete PHPTelnet.php--it is not used by Grouper.
	However, if you are a PHP programmer, you may find it useful.
	See the <a href="http://www.geckotribe.com/php-telnet/">PHP Telnet homepage</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>
