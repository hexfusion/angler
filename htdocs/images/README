html2text Version 0.001
=======================

Description
-----------

html2text.pl generates simple formatted text from HTML. It uses
HTML::Element to traverse an HTML tree built by HTML::TreeBuilder, and formats
the output text using Text::Format. It is _very_ simple at the moment. The
type of things it does are:

* Headings

    All headings are underlined. <H1>s are double underlined. Headings are
    numbered, by using the heading levels, and previous heading levels.

* Paragraphs

    Paragraph text is formatted with the paragraph method of Text::Format.

* Lists

    List items are indented by 4 spaces, and preceded with an asterisk.

* Definition Lists

    <DT>s are intented by 4 spaces; <DD>s are indented by 8 spaces.

It doesn't do anything clever with frames, tables, fonts, etc. Images and links
are ignored.

Installation
