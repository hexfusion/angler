<h1>Return Policy</h1>
<p>We guarantee your total satisfaction and offer a world-class returns policy. If your new and unused gear just doesn't fit your needs, we will issue you a full refund. Any new or unused returns must be in the condition you received them in with the original box and/or packaging and the manufacturer tags where applicable. Additionally, we accept used gear for store credit so long as we receive it within 90 days of purchase. If your gear fails due to manufacturing defect, we welcome you to contact us in order to facilitate a warranty evaluation by the manufacturer.</p>
<h2>Exchanges</h2>
<p>If you’d like to exchange your product for something else, the best thing to do is to return your item and place a new order at the same time. Placing the new order now just ensures that you’ll get it quickly, and that it won’t go out of stock. If the item returned is in the condition you received it in and with the original box and/or packaging, then you'll get a full refund. If the item is used, then you'll receive store credit. Don’t worry, you’ll get your refund or credit as soon as our Returns Department receives your original package.</p>
<p>Hang on, we have more info for you. To make the return/exchange process super speedy, we can create an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number for you, or you can make it yourself. If it's been awhile, or you already threw out your receipt, you can still return any order. </p>
<h2>Shipping</h2>
<p>Once you create a return for an item, you will have the ability to print a UPS return label from us for $6.99.  This service is available only for US customers and will not work for items that ship freight.  The $6.99 will be deducted from your refund on the item(s) that you have returned.  All you have to do is print the label, stick it on the package and drop the package off at a UPS store at your convenience.</p>
<p>If you choose to pay for shipping back on your own, write the RMA number on the outside of your package.   Write the RMA number on the back of your sales receipt in the returns section making sure to fill out all pertinent information.  It just makes warehouse-routing quicker- like warp-speed for exchanges. Once you’ve labeled your package with its RMA number and included the sales receipt, send it off to the address below:</p>
<p>West Branch Angler<br />
℅ Returns<br />
150 Faulkener Rd<br />
Hancock, NY 13783<br /></p>
<p>If you mailed your package back to us, and you haven't received your refund or store credit yet, don't panic. You'll get it. It generally takes about 3-5 business days after the package arrives at our warehouse for your return to be processed. When it is received, you will get an email confirmation. If you sent your package back to us using UPS, Fed Ex or USPS, and you have a tracking number or delivery confirmation, you can let us know, and we'll do our best to expedite the process. To give us all those sweet confirmation numbers, or if you have questions, please see our contact info below.</p>
