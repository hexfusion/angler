<p align="left">You can see the estimated arrival dates of your order during checkout.</p>

<p align="left">To calculate the estimated arrival dates, we add the time it takes to process your order before it ships plus the time it takes to arrive at your shipping address after it leaves our warehouse.</p>

<p align="left">Most packages in your order can be tracked via our carriers' websites. It may take up to 1 business day for your information to be posted on the carrier's website from the date your order is shipped. Order tracking is available for orders placed within the last 60 days. <a href="[area customerservice.html]">Sign in to your account</a> to track a shipped order.</p>

<p align="left">We're sorry, at this time we cannot provide tracking information for international shipments.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Please note:</strong> <br>
