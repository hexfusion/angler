        Run Restaurant</a> </b> is being expanded to nearly double the original
        size by the spring of 2004.&nbsp; We continue to have significant use
        of our resort by larger groups, such as businesses, clubs and others
        who hold meetings and other functions during their stay. In addition,
        demand by local residents has grown as they look for accommodations for
        larger functions such as weddings, family reunions and the like.&nbsp; We
        all this growth over the last few years it was to the point where more
        meeting space was truly needed. <img border="0" src="http://www.westbranchresort.com/images/rivrunext.gif" align="right" width="320" height="240"><br>
        We made the decision to provide a separate section of River Run that
        would take care of these needs.&nbsp; The addition would also provide
        state of the art video, audio, and communication functions that would
        be needed to accomplish the goals of our group clients.&nbsp; This expansion
        gives us the capability to offer meeting space dedicated to just the
        group meeting without interference with our normal dining room activities.&nbsp; Now
        business functions can operate with seamless transitions to other activities
        such as having meals with out interruptions for the meal set ups.&nbsp; We
        even have satellite hook ups for the Internet in the new addition, so
        as to provide meeting-to-office contact for those groups who require
        it.&nbsp; Further, the meeting section will be audio/visual friendly
        so that setups and presentations can be made with ease.<br>
        In addition to the meeting room expansion, the &quot;Exercise Room&quot; that
        was originally located in the indoor section of the pavilion, will be
        re-located to a special section of the new River Run addition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </font>&nbsp;<br>

            course</b> located up the hill behind the White House Lodge had become
            dated and needed to be completely renovated.&nbsp; Instead of just
            upgrading that course, the decision was made to build a brand new
            course this one to be located up the mountain behind the River Run
            Restaurant and abandon almost all of the old course.&nbsp; <br>
        After several delays and many struggles due to very wet weather, we were
        finally able to get the course completed in September of 2003.&nbsp; It
        was designed by John Higgins, an Orvis shooting course consultant from
        England.&nbsp; The River Run course has twelve great stations with two
        state of the art electric target throwers at each.&nbsp; Now we can throw
        targets in directions and angles that because of safety would be impossible
        with manual traps.<img border="0" src="http://www.westbranchresort.com/images/sprtshtercartssml.jpg" align="left" width="349" height="181"><br>
        John Higgins did a great job.&nbsp; It's a beauty of a course, and not
        easy either, but well worth the effort to shoot it.&nbsp; There are traps
        that simulate grouse, teal, wood ducks, driven pheasants, running rabbits,
        decoying ducks, flushing quail, woodcock and more.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until
        you see our neat new “off road” <b>clays carts!</b> You'll ride between

            people had ask if along with Sporting Clays, why we couldn't do a
            Hunting Preserve.&nbsp; We went to work, and came up with a preserve
            here on the property that would allow our guests in the months of
            September through November and beyond, weather permitting, to do
            fun guided hunts without a hassle.&nbsp; <img border="0" src="http://www.westbranchresort.com/images/shootfieldsml.jpg" align="left" width="204" height="153"><br>
        You'll hunt Chukar Partridge and Pheasants with one of our guides through
        a true diversity of cover and habitat here at the preserve.&nbsp; You'll
        hunt in open fields and overgrown orchards.&nbsp; Much of the preserve
        has groomed trails through fairly level terrain. No hunting license is
        required to hunt on the preserve with one of our guides.&nbsp; Your experienced
        WBA hunting guide will provide the world class hunting dog (of course

        bird hunt.<br>
        For the outdoor sports person looking for added challenge, in both quarry
        and terrain, we also offer off property guided wild Ruffed grouse and
        American Woodcock hunts on land that our guides have spent many preseason
        days scouting out for the best local coverts.&nbsp; A New York Hunting

                      far cry from 2002, as our winter was cold and wet, and
                      the summer even wetter.&nbsp; The West, East, and Main
                      Delaware Rivers fished like a house on fire early in the
                      season, with MAJOR BIG fish taking dry flies like candy.&nbsp; Our
                      guides got so used to getting 20 inch + fish for their
                      clients that they had real withdrawal when the size was
                      UNDER 20 inches!!&nbsp; <br>
        We all had some excellent fishing opportunities with a myriad of hatches.&nbsp; The
        Hendrickson hatch was the largest we have seen in 6 years or so.&nbsp; Ephemerella
        subvaria started early and appeared for well over a month, with big fish
        keying on them continually.&nbsp; Sizes 14 and 16, males and females,
        it was to die for!&nbsp; March Browns were good to<img border="0" src="http://www.westbranchresort.com/images/wba2haleddy.jpg" align="left" width="307" height="230">o,
        and so were the Early Black Stones.&nbsp; Paraleps aka blue quills were
        also a strong hatch.&nbsp; The drakes began in earnest in late May and
        early June, with the Green Drake adults and Coffin Flies bringing up
        the big hungry Browns and Rainbows to dine in style.&nbsp; In fact, the
        Drakes lasted for several weeks, much much longer than normal.&nbsp; As
        usual caddis were in abundance with various colors and genus working
        all through the system.&nbsp; Tan caddis in particular were excellent,
        with Spent Caddis in tan being most effective.&nbsp; The only true disappointment
        was with the Sulphur hatch in June.&nbsp; Though there were some nice
        hatches of Invaria, Dorethea, and even a few Rotunda on the main stem,
        over all the hatch was anemic to say the least.<br>
        The spinner falls this past season were feast or famine.&nbsp; There
        were times when it would happen when it shouldn't have, and other times
        we expected it and it didn't happen.&nbsp; Ahhh...that's why the call
        it fishing!<br>
        The mid season slow down of hatches occurred per usual, but not for long
        as the trico hatch was fairly good, and the minute, size 20 and 22 flying
        ants also appeared in August.&nbsp; We had hebe's in September, and the
        Isonychia were good in August and September too.&nbsp; In late September
        and October there were good pseudo action with sizes ranging from 22
        to 28, and a few Autumn Sedge in size 12 as well.&nbsp; All in all it
        was a great season.&nbsp; We had healthy fish, and a good spawn.&nbsp; We
        caught big fish in the early season, then smaller Fish in mid-season,
        and back to larger fish at the end of the season. </span><br>

                      all of us musing as to just what to expect.&nbsp; Throwing
                      caution to the wind, we will toss out an educated guess.&nbsp; If
                      patterns hold true, we have swung to a feast of water in
                      2003, from the famine of H²O in 2002.&nbsp; So it stands
                      to reason that the pendulum will swing back, but hopefully
                      not as far.&nbsp; The theory sounds good!....but will it
                      actually work out that way?&nbsp; Farmer's Almanacs, Crystal
                      Balls, and Ouji Boards are all being ground together with
                      the mortar and pestle of visionary insight so we can come
                      up with the definitive answer.&nbsp; MMMmmm....isn't working.<br>
        Let me say here and now, that with magic put aside, this great river
        system seems to somehow always offer good fishing opportunities somewhere
        along the stretches of one of the Delaware River tributaries no matter
        which hydrological condition exists.&nbsp; In addition realistic goals
        are being worked for by the Delaware River Foundation, other conservation
        groups, as well as political action committees, to protect and insure
        the safety of the river system, which of course includes the trout and
        invertebrates that abound here.&nbsp; These organizations are working
        primarily as volunteer/non-profit organizations, with contributions as
        their life-blood.&nbsp; So far with generosity from those of us who love
        the river system they are making good headway.&nbsp; Your contribution
        to one of these groups, either of time or money, can be a great assistance
        to making this river system become better every year.<br>
        So, will the fishing be good in 2004?&nbsp; YOU BET!&nbsp; It will be
        good because the fish will be here. The Mayflies and Caddis will be here.&nbsp; The
        opportunity to put a dry fly over a rising fish will be here for those
        wishing to try.&nbsp; Will it be easy?&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; But if it were
        easy, then everyone would do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></span> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>

      <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Verdana"> <b>Many modern fly fishermen</b>,
          especially those who have started in the last ten years, are blissfully
          unaware of the oldest, easiest, and often the most effective fly-fishing
          technique of all. Nymphs are “in” and wet flies are “passé”, but anglers
          are making a mistake if they don’t get reacquainted with the classic
          soft hackles and winged wets.&nbsp; <br>
        Wets are the most versatile of all fly types. You can dead drift them,
        swing them, or do both on one cast. You can fish them deep or at the
        surface. A damp (barely sunk) wet fly was the original emerger.&nbsp; <img border="0" src="http://www.westbranchresort.com/images/hndrcksnwet.jpg" align="left" width="190" height="125"><br>
        The original Yorkshire soft hackle fishermen worked quartering upstream
        casts with a dead drift back to them; sort of nymphing with no weight.
        Today most people think of quartering down stream or across stream casts
        with a rather fast swing. I often do a combination of both. Cast across
        or across slightly upstream and immediately do a vigorous back mend to
        keep the current from pulling the line and fly downstream. Watch the
        end of your fly line during this initial dead drift phase across from
        your position. If the line does anything weird- set up. Since your backmend
        removed/ delayed tension on the line, the fly will sink and slowly drift.
        Use smaller corrective mends to delay the current from causing a downstream
        belly, which speeds up the fly. What you’re trying to do is get a smooth
        transition from a sinking dead drift to a slow rising swing. Lead the
        line downstream with your rod tip till the line straightens below you
        and let it hang for a few seconds.&nbsp; <br>
        Most strikes come during the initial dead drift, at the beginning of
        the swing, and at the end of the swing below you. Initially you must
        see the strike by watching the line, but once the line pulls tight and
        swings, you will feel everything. Sometimes the fish will hook themselves,
        and sometimes you will miss a lot of light strikes. It depends on how
        aggressive or timid the fish are that day.&nbsp; <br>
        This is probably the best method for searching a lot of water and is
        an excellent way to explore new streams. It tends to work best in medium
        to shallow riffles, pocket water, and the heads and tails of pools.&nbsp; I
        always fish with two or three wets spaced about 24 inches apart. With
        this rig fished as described above, you can present different flies with
        different action to every fish in a riffle and let them make the choice.
        It’s a good way to learn what’s going on quickly and then adjust.&nbsp; <br>
        The best wet fly that I’ve used over the last 40 years would be the Leadwing
        Coachman, hands down. Other winged wets that are deadly are the Gold
        Rib Hare’s Ear and the Light Cahill. My favorite soft hackles are the
        Partridge &amp; Pheasant Tail, March Brown Spider, Grouse &amp; Green,
        and Tup’s Indispensable. Sizes from No. 8 to 18 all have their days on
        fertile rivers like the Delaware.&nbsp; <br>
        Rig some up, get in touch with history, and catch some fish. Good Luck. </font> </p>

      <p align="justify"> <font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Early in the 1900’s</b>,
          the British developed a clay target shooting game designed to prepare
          the shooter for the hunt.&nbsp; In the 1980’s this clay target game
          crossed the Atlantic and now in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century it has
          found its way to West Branch Angler.&nbsp; Some call sporting clays “golf
          with a shotgun” as the game is played around a course of several different
          stations offering different target presentations at each.&nbsp; <br>
        Our course features twelve professionally designed stations with two
        automatic traps (target throwers) at each.&nbsp; This allows us to throw
        targets in directions and angles that a course with manual traps could
        not safely present.&nbsp; Usually fifty or a hundred targets are thrown.&nbsp; <br>
        Our stations are set in natural surroundings and feature targets that
        simulate grouse, teal, wood ducks, driven pheasants, running rabbits,
        decoying ducks, flushing quail, and woodcock, to just name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
        custom designed “off road” <b>clays cars</b> transport you to the course
        and allow you the option of walking or riding from one station <img border="0" src="http://www.westbranchresort.com/images/spshootergirl.jpg" align="right" width="226" height="115">to
        the next.&nbsp; On your next visit to our resort bring along your shotgun
        or borrow one of ours and test your wing shooting skills.&nbsp; I can’t
        think of a more fun way to fill the time between the morning and evening
        rise.&nbsp; <br>
        Never shot before? No problem.&nbsp; Our trappers are well versed in
        firearm safety and can provide you with instruction and tips to get you
        breaking some targets.&nbsp; We also have a special introduction package
        available.&nbsp;We require everyone on the course to wear eye and ear
        protection.&nbsp; Maximum shotgun loads are 12 gauge 1.1/8 oz of 7.1/2
        shot.&nbsp; Ammo (12 &amp; 20 gauge), shooting glasses, and ear protection
        are available at the fly shop, or bring your own.&nbsp; Reservations
        are required.&nbsp; If you are coming with a group, let us arrange a
        fun shoot for you either as part of a fishing package or as a separate
        activity.&nbsp; Corporate and social outings are our specialty.</font></p>

  Verdana">Eddy</span></font></b><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2"><b> Bridge</b> I
                            wondered if the decision I made was a wise one.&nbsp; Moving
                            500 miles away from my home in Ohio, to a place I
                            had never been, all because I would have the chance
                            to live near and fish a world-class trout river.<br>
        Arriving the first week of May the Blue Quills, Hendrickson’s and various
        caddis were the bugs to expect on the West Branch.&nbsp; That was the
        place to go, I was told, after conferring with Larry, the West Branch
        guides, and whoever else was in the fly shop swapping stories at the
        time.&nbsp; The main Delaware was too high to wade and the West Branch
        was dropping to around 1000 cubic feet per second, which is not that
        easily waded.&nbsp;&nbsp; After settling in and purchasing a New York
        fishing license, I asked Larry at the fly shop for some advice on some
        local places where I could gain access to the river.&nbsp; Larry told
        me of a dozen public access points within 5 miles, so the choice was
        mine.<br>
        I soon found out the West Branch is a big river, much larger than the
        small spring creeks and mountain streams where I usually fished for trout.&nbsp; I
        also quickly found out that this big river has some big, wary browns
        and rainbows.&nbsp; As anyone who has fished the West Branch can attest,
        it doesn’t take long standing amongst a pod of rising 15-20 inch wild
        trout to realize the fishing can be good.&nbsp; Real good!&nbsp; And
        fishing is what I was doing.&nbsp; Not catching that many fish, considering
        all the opportunities I was given.&nbsp; But the ones I caught were nice,
        healthy, wild, technical to catch and above all rewarding fish.&nbsp; I
        quickly realized I needed to adjust my fishing techniques and equipment
        to improve my success.&nbsp; Those adjustments were made easily with
        help from my experienced and friendly co-workers at the West Branch Angler.&nbsp; I
        gathered tips on flies, tying materials, casting, mending line and much,
        much more.&nbsp; <br>
        There were two tips that helped me the most, being a Delaware newcomer.&nbsp; First,
        use fairly sparse, low-riding flies when fishing dries.&nbsp; Deer hair
        comparaduns, CDC comparaduns and various emerger styles seem to be good
        patterns that work well.&nbsp; Emergers seem to work very well during
        most hatches, especially during a really “heavy” hatch.&nbsp; Many times
        these fish have so many insects to choose from they will “key-in” on
        a vulnerable stage of the bug and take only that stage of the insect.&nbsp; This
        happened a lot to me early in the spring.&nbsp; There would be duns covering
        the water, trout sipping all around me, and I would watch in anticipation
        as my pretty dun imitation drifted drag free right over the feeding fish.&nbsp; Soon
        I realized that a good snowshoe rabbit foot or CDC emerger was my “go-to” fly
        during a hatch.&nbsp; A good dry fly cripple or wet fly also can be deadly
        at such times. <br>
        The other tip I picked up seemed to be equally important if not more
        important than the first.&nbsp; Always attempt to make a quartering downstream
        cast to the fish and make sure there is no drag.&nbsp; In some rivers
        casting upstream to rising fish can be fairly effective but can prove
        to be very tough on the Delaware.&nbsp; If you get upstream from a fish,
        undetected, you now need to make a good cast that puts the line on the
        water correctly.&nbsp; A good reach cast is a way to put your line in
        a position so it doesn’t cause your fly to drag prematurely.&nbsp; Sometimes
        you are casting 20 feet, other times 70, but a good reach at the end
        will definitely help out.&nbsp; This is where good gear will come in
        handy.&nbsp; The slow, 6 ½-8-foot rods that I have for fishing those
        smaller streams need another foot or two to really be effective on the
        Delaware.&nbsp; I can’t tell you how much it helps to have a good, high-performance
        fly rod that is at least 9 feet when fishing the Delaware.&nbsp; These
        longer, faster rods allow you to reach more fish, cast in the wind and
        reduce the amount of fish-spooking false casts when making any cast.<br>
        Looking back on my decision to move to New York and fish the Delaware,
        was it a good one?&nbsp; Well, my first week I caught several fish on
        dries over 19 inches and had a brown swim within feet of me that had
        to be 30 inches.&nbsp; Definitely a good decision! </font></span></p>

color:#333333">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        The principles behind <b><i>Leadership on the Fly</i></b> began to form
        in the early 90’s when I took over the corporate Marketing Training for
        a Fortune 100 firm.&nbsp; We employed a stable of the finest MBA level
        professors from such places as Harvard, Wharton, Kellogg, and </span> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;
  font-family:Verdana;color:#333333">University</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#333333"> of
        Michigan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, responsible for preparing a training program,
        it occurred to me: <i>&nbsp;Do these concepts that we teach actually
        help improve our company’s results?</i>&nbsp; Little did I know then
        that this simple question would forever change my life.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:#333333"> The answers I received from our “stable of experts” regarding
        this questions was always similar: <i>trust the ideas of Marketing</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
        one regard, this reply appealed to me having been taught these same lessons
        as a Marketing major in college.&nbsp; Instead, I decided to challenge
        these ideas and to learn for myself what truly drives company performance.&nbsp; Ironically,
        my research suggested that it was possible to build a successful, profitable
        company without a Marketing department, and results could be sustained
        for long periods of time. <br>
        By 1993, I was introduced to Jim Collins, a rising luminary at </span> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#333333"> Stanford
        University.&nbsp;Our paths crossed at just the right time to help me
        challenge some long-held views about business and organizations.&nbsp; Jim
        was then researching the question: <i>How do some companies become truly “great” companies.&nbsp; </i>One
        idea Jim advanced, the <i>Genius of And</i>, didn’t reveal its promise
        until I started teaching personnel inside my company.&nbsp; </span> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:#333333"><br>
        It quickly became apparent that people had huge mental blocks to learning
        and embracing the new ideas.&nbsp;However, a difficult consulting project
        in 1996 helped me overcome this.&nbsp;&nbsp;The project required teaching
        125 international cross-functional people a newly developed company strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though
        I had taught many workshops already, this particular company leader made
        it clear: <i>I had to use relevant examples that would part the clouds
        and cause complete acceptance of the new strategy, AND do it in only
        4 hours</i>.&nbsp; After numerous false starts, I had to admit that I
        was stumped. I finally escaped for my annual fall salmon fly fishing
        trip with a bunch of friends to the </span> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#333333"> Pere
        Marquette River in Michigan.&nbsp; Amongst fish and friends, the fast
        approaching deadline stirred the idea of using fish and fishing as a
        metaphor to explain business.&nbsp; Serendipity is sometimes the offspring
        of desperation.&nbsp; </span><i> <span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:#333333">AND</span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:#333333"> what I found in that meeting and every workshop since is whether
        a person fishes or not, no matter their homeland, or gender, this metaphor
        is a powerful way to break through the mental barriers that hold our
        businesses and people back. <i>&nbsp;AND </i>while not everyone is a
        master angler, mastery of the principles can make a person a better leader,
        businessperson, human being, and perhaps a better angler too.&nbsp; <br>
        Many of you may think that you must choose between going fly fishing <b><i>or</i></b> going
        to work <b><i>or</i></b> going to the many important meetings on your
        schedule.&nbsp; <b> <i>Leadership on the Fly</i></b> will teach you that
        these are not exclusive pursuits.&nbsp; Now, the next step in your journey
      is to embrace the <i>Power of AND </i>as I did<i>:</i></span></p>
