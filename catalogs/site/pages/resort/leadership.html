      <p align="left"> Leadership on the Fly&trade; is based upon the old proverb: &ldquo;Give a person a fish and you feed them for a day. Teach them to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
      <p align="left">It&rsquo;s not just a clever saying anymore, we take this concept literally- teaching leaders in our one-of-a-kind, interactive workshop that combines business and nature.</p>
      <p align="left">&ldquo;While I had never fished in my life, I found the experience showed me a lot about managing people and better ways to focus my actions on my goals. We succeeded in catching fish, and I also learned a lot about my leadership style.&rdquo; <br>
