        as one of the East&#8217;s premier wild trout fly fishing destinations, 
        now offers it's guests the opportunity to hunt ringneck pheasant, chukar 
        partridge, ruffed grouse, American woodcock and wild turkey.<br>
        River Run Hunting Preserve is on our property and offers our guests pheasant 
        and chukar hunts for flight conditioned game birds through a diversity 
        of cover and habitat that ranges from open fields to overgrown orchards. 
        Much of the grounds have groomed trails through a fairly level countryside. 
        You will not need a New York hunting license on the preserve.</p>
      <p>Our hunts for ruffed grouse and American woodcock are for the sportsman 
        looking for the added challenge, in both quarry and terrain that a wild 
        bird hunt can offer. Our guides spend many preseason days scouting and 
        looking for the best coverts.&nbsp;The traditions of the hunt are important 
        to us. We require all hunts to be accompanied by one of our expert guides 
        and world class bird dogs. Of course, you are also welcome to bring your 
        own bird dog on all hunts. A New York Hunting License is required.<br>

      land during the spring season. Hunt for big Toms with large spurs and long 
      beards in the early AM through noon. If you are an avid turkey hunter, you 
      will love tracking and taking these big birds with many in the 20+ pound 
      category. Due to guide availability very limited numbers of turkey hunts 
      are scheduled each season, and advanced bookings are required. A New York 
      Hunting license and Turkey Permit is required.</td>
