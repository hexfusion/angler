        growing sports in the country. In keeping with this increased popularity
        our newly redesigned and expanded course has dramatically added to the
        diversity of our target presentations. The fun and excitement of the
        game is found in the many varied clay targets thrown to simulate real
        life shooting challenges like driven pheasants, springing teal, ruffed
        grouse, woodcock, quail, rabbit and others. Shooting hours are regularly
        scheduled. The minimum reservation is for two shooters (<strong>single
        shooters MUST shoot a double round</strong>). Shooting is limited to five people in one
        group. Groups larger than five will be split into smaller groups. You
        must bring your own shotgun. Our new clays course with 12 automatic stations
        is set amidst the hillsides among the old growth hemlocks, open hardwood
        forests and ancient orchards, creating scenery that has to been seen
        to truly appreciated. Our course was designed by John Higgins, and will
        challenge the experienced shooter yet will be enjoyable for the novice.
        The course is great fun but in an effort to make the course like real hunting it will prove to be very physically challenging, please plan accordingly.  Come and try
        sporting clays at The West Branch Angler, and you'll agree that we have
        done it right! <br> 
<br>
<font color="#CC0000"><strong>NOTICE: If you are interested in shooting our course we do have a 24 hour reservation policy please contact the shop directly to add this to your reservation (no exceptions).  All shoots will take place after 12:00 EST and guests will have precedent over non guests.</stong></font></p>
