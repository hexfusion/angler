          <p align="left">The River Run Restaurant is recently being expanded to almost 
            double the size. This increased square footage was designed not only for 
            those looking for a relaxing dining experience in our fabulous dining room, 
            but also for those looking for that special place to host their events. 
            The expansion has the capability of offering a total of 3600 square feet, 
            or be split into two separate rooms that will give privacy for each event. 
            From corporate meetings, wedding and baby showers, rehearsal dinners, Christmas 
            and birthday parties to family reunions, the River Run Restaurant will make 
            it one to remember.          </p>
        </div>
          Corporate events are easily accommodated. The main restaurant, both meeting 
          rooms and the <img src="http://www.westbranchresort.com/images/drfmeet2.jpg" alt="#" width="235" height="134" border="1" align="right">TroutSkellar 
          are all available if needed. The new meeting rooms were designed with today's 
          high tech needs in mind, with satellite internet connections, and audio 
          visual needs ready for any type of meeting. In addition, for larger groups 
          the entire resort may be reserved at a special rate. Call us for more details 
          for what will be a totally unique business/activity meeting for your company.</td>
