      <p><strong><font color="#003399">June:</font></strong><br>
        As June begins the largest of the Delaware&#8217;s Mayfly&#8217;s will 
        begin to emerge, the Green and Brown Drakes. In size 8 2 and 3xl the Drakes 
        provide exciting dry fly fishing opportunities. With the Drakes come Sulphurs, 
        Cornuta, March Browns and Isonychia. This meadly of large Mayfly&#8217;s 
        makes June a great month for all dry fly fanatics.</p>

      <p><strong><font color="#003399">July:</font></strong><br>
        As water levels decrease on the Delaware the River Master is forced to 
        increase releases from the upstream reservoir systems to keep minimum 
        target flows. These cold water release&#8217;s make for great summer fishing 
        while most streams are unfishable due to low and warm water. With water 
        temps in the high 50&#8217;s and low 60&#8217;s the trout are active with 
        great afternoon and evening hatches. Be prepared to fish smaller tippets 
        (6x and 7x) as the Sulphur&#8217;s and Olives are in the #18 and #20 range 
        with #14 Lt. Cahills being the exception. Subsurface nymphing and late 
        evening spinner falls can provide excellent all day fishing opportunities. 
        Crowds in July tend to be mild and June like fishing opportunities are 
        at each bend.</p>

      <p><strong><font color="#003399">August:</font></strong><br>
        The warm late summer mornings bring the Tricos out in clouds. Depending 
        on the day the Tricos can start at sunrise and go until 10:00 &#8211; 
        11:00am. The Tricos along with Sulphur and Blue Winged Olive Duns and 
        Isonychia make August an exciting month for dry fly fishing. In years 
        past with steady release&#8217;s we have had Sulphur hatches that you 
        can set your clock to. Long leaders and fine tippets make August fishing 
        much like that of a spring creek. The lower main step gets a great White 
        Fly Hatch which is usually the last week in August.</p>

      <p><strong><font color="#003399">September:</font></strong><br>
        The majestic fall foliage of the Catskill Mountains as well as cool summer 
        nights brings great fishing together with wonderful scenery. Blind casting 
        Isonychia can prove to be very effective, but small olives are really 
        the main food of choice. Favorite time of year for many locals and guides 
        the wonderful foliage background mixed with light crowds and mild temps 
        makes September a great month for relaxing and fishing.</p>

      <p><strong><font color="#003399">October:</font></strong><br>
        This month is much like September and fishing can be good but is much 
        less consistant. Blind casting Isonychia can prove to be effective, but 
        small olives are really the main food of choice. Important to note that 
        the water in front of West Branch Angler is closed after the end of September. 
        The lower West Branch and Main Stem are open year around as well as the 
        no kill section of the Beaverkill. So plently of fishable waters and great 
        for a relaxing experience in your favorite pool without another soul around.</p>
