      <p><font color="#003399"><strong>April:<br>
        </strong></font>Winter run off on top of precipitation usually has the 
        river running relatively high during the first couple of weeks of the 
        month. This higher water level usually causes the water come over the 
        top of the dam spilling thousands of bait fish &#8220;Alewives&#8221; 
        over into the system. This surge of bait fish on top of the off color 
        volume of the river causes the large browns to feast comfortably even 
        during the day. The great part about this is that you have cracks at 10lb 
        plus browns that you would never see any other time during the year as 
        they are nocturnal.</p>
      <p>As soon as the water temps start to warm early black stones will begin 
        to emerge and will start the dry fly activity for the season. Depending 
        on water temps Blue Quill, Hendrickson&#8217;s and Quill Gordon&#8217;s 
        can be seen as early as the last week in April. Fish have not been caught 
        in months and with the high water are easy picking. Best time of the year 
        to pick up a trophy brown on a streamer.</p>

      <p><strong><font color="#003399">May:<br>
        </font></strong>As the water temps continue to increase into the low 50&#8217;s 
        fish begin to become more active on the surface. This is also in part 
        due to a huge surge in aquatic life as we begin to go through the entire 
        Catskills lineup of Mayfly&#8217;s from Blue Quill to March Browns. By 
        far the most popular and bust time of the year May can provide the finest 
        Fly Fishing this site of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

      <p><strong><font color="#003399">June:</font></strong><br>
        As June begins the largest of the Delaware&#8217;s Mayfly&#8217;s will 
        begin to emerge, the Green and Brown Drakes. In size 8 2 and 3xl the Drakes 
        provide exciting dry fly fishing opportunities. With the Drakes come Sulphurs, 
        Cornuta, March Browns and Isonychia. This meadly of large Mayfly&#8217;s 
        makes June a great month for all dry fly fanatics.</p>

      <p><strong><font color="#003399">July:</font></strong><br>
        As water levels decrease on the Delaware the River Master is forced to 
        increase releases from the upstream reservoir systems to keep minimum 
        target flows. These cold water release&#8217;s make for great summer fishing 
        while most streams are unfishable due to low and warm water. With water 
        temps in the high 50&#8217;s and low 60&#8217;s the trout are active with 
        great afternoon and evening hatches. Be prepared to fish smaller tippets 
        (6x and 7x) as the Sulphur&#8217;s and Olives are in the #18 and #20 range 
        with #14 Lt. Cahills being the exception. Subsurface nymphing and late 
        evening spinner falls can provide excellent all day fishing opportunities. 
        Crowds in July tend to be mild and June like fishing opportunities are 
        at each bend.</p>

      <p><strong><font color="#003399">August:</font></strong><br>
        The warm late summer mornings bring the Tricos out in clouds. Depending 
        on the day the Tricos can start at sunrise and go until 10:00 &#8211; 
        11:00am. The Tricos along with Sulphur and Blue Winged Olive Duns and 
        Isonychia make August an exciting month for dry fly fishing. In years 
        past with steady release&#8217;s we have had Sulphur hatches that you 
        can set your clock to. Long leaders and fine tippets make August fishing 
        much like that of a spring creek. The lower main step gets a great White 
        Fly Hatch which is usually the last week in August.</p>

      <p><strong><font color="#003399">September:</font></strong><br>
        The majestic fall foliage of the Catskill Mountains as well as cool summer 
        nights brings great fishing together with wonderful scenery. Blind casting 
        Isonychia can prove to be very effective, but small olives are really 
        the main food of choice. Favorite time of year for many locals and guides 
        the wonderful foliage background mixed with light crowds and mild temps 
        makes September a great month for relaxing and fishing.</p>

      <p><strong><font color="#003399">October:</font></strong><br>
        This month is much like September and fishing can be good but is much 
        less consistant. Blind casting Isonychia can prove to be effective, but 
        small olives are really the main food of choice. Important to note that 
        the water in front of West Branch Angler is closed after the end of September. 
        The lower West Branch and Main Stem are open year around as well as the 
        no kill section of the Beaverkill. So plently of fishable waters and great 
        for a relaxing experience in your favorite pool without another soul around.</p>
