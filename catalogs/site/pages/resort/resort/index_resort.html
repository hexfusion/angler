        Upland Bird Hunting is now available at the West Branch Resort. We offer 
        customized guide packages to fit any hunter&#8217;s needs. It does not 
        matter if you are an experienced bird hunter with your own dog, or someone 
        interested in entering a new field of an old sporting tradition, we can 
        offer you a truly unique experience that you will not soon forget. </font><font size="2">

        have several trained bird dogs available for your adventure. These dogs 
        are all pure bred and live for only one reason&#8230;.. &#8220;to hunt.&#8221; 
        Our dogs consist of English Setters, English Pointers and Black Labs and 
        they will vigorously work to make sure that they find you all the pheasant, 
        chukar, or grouse that you can handle. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The lots we are hunting 
        are adjacent to the West Branch of the Delaware and consist of small plots 
        of woods, rows of corn, and heavy concentrations of sorghum, proving excellent 
        cover for birds and challenging, yet fun shots for all the members in 
        your party. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the end of your 
        hunt, our fully trained guides will field dress your fresh kills and prepare 
        them for your transportation home. Or if you decide to stay with us, they 
        can provide excellent recipes for a BBQ that evening. This will surly 
        be an event that you and your friends will enjoy and remember forever.
