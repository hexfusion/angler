    <td valign="bottom">The <font color="#CC0000"><strong>Upper Delaware River 
      System</strong></font> is indeed a fly fisherman's paradise. Steeped in 
      the history of the earliest fly fishing in America, the Catskills is where 
      it all began. The area offers many beautiful rivers to choose from; all 
      offering excellent fish habitats, and featuring varied species to test your 
      angling skills. Whether you fish the <a href="#wb">West Branch</a>, the 
      <a href="#eb">East Branch</a>, or the <a href="#ms">Main Delaware</a>, you'll 
      fall in love with our area and our fishery.</td>

    <td valign="bottom"> <p><a name="wb"></a>The <font color="#CC0000"><strong>West 
        Branch of the Delaware River</strong></font>, where the West Branch Angler 
        Resort is located, is the crown jewel of the upper Delaware. The river 
        is a tailwater fishery that receives good cold water from Cannonsville 
        Reservoir. Cannonsville is owned and operated by New York City, and by 
        law must provide releases for the needs of states, cities, and towns down 
        river on the Main Delaware River. The releases are monitored continually 
        by the New York DEC, as the health of this wild trout fishery is of major 
        importance to the area. The releases are accomplished through a valve 
        system, that can be opened inch by inch, so that flows can be raised or 
        lowered incrementally, thus avoiding sudden changes to the river levels 
        and water temperatures. Wild Browns are the main specie in the West Branch, 
        amounting to about 90% of the total trout population, with Wild Rainbows 
        making up the final 10%.</p>
      <p>This river is wonderful to behold. Though a large river, for the most 
        part the West Branch fishes small. It meanders slowly through farm land 
        and woodlands, moving almost spring creek like in most places, with rising 
        trout working to such a variety of hatches that it is almost easier to 
        say what doesn't hatch on the West Branch of the Delaware. The hatches 
        during 2002 were excellent, from mid-April through June. The Early Quills 
        and the Early Black Stones were again abundant, and the Hendrickson was 
        good, but still not as strong as we have come to expect over the years. 
        During May, the Apple Caddis was fair. BH Tan Caddis Pupa worked extremely 
        well for almost all of the early and mid season. Stenonema such as March 
        Browns were again excellent in May with tremendous hatches throughout 
        the system. Green Drakes and Brown Drakes were terrific this year all 
        through the system.&nbsp;The Green Drake as the best most of us have ever 
        seen with the hatches lasting over 3 weeks!&nbsp;Cahill&nbsp;and Gray 
        Fox were good during the summer.&nbsp;The Sulphur hatches were also good, 
        but not as strong as last year.&nbsp;Lack of rain kept these hatches good 
        into August, as cold water releases from Cannonsville were steady to deal 
        with the drought.&nbsp;Streamer patterns were very weak, since the Alewives 
        were not coming out of the reservoir. The Trico was fair this season, 
        which we believe was due to cold high water releases late in August and 
        September..&nbsp;The Isonychia has been without question the strongest 
        hatch of the part two seasons.&nbsp;However, this year there were far 
        less than we have gotten used to. The Yellow Drake, Ephemera Varia, and 
        the Golden Drake, aka Potamanthus were both sporadic during July and early 
        August as usual, and Heptigenia Hebe was good beginning in late August, 
        with Sulphur patterns effectively imitating the Hebe through October. 
        The BWO's were effective all season, as we saw sizes ranging from 18 to 
        28.&nbsp;End of season fishing with Midge &amp; BWO patterns in size 26 
        and 28 were&nbsp;effective in November as well. See our Hatch Chart for 
        the West Branch.</p></td>

    <td valign="top"> <p><a name="eb" id="eb"></a>The <font color="#CC0000">East 
        Branch of the Delaware</font> is a tailwater fishery that receives water 
        from Pepacton Reservoir, as well as from the Beaverkill which is a freestone 
        river. Pepacton is a New York City reservoir and is a reserve for drinking 
        water for the city. The Lower East Branch tends to work more like a freestone, 
        with early season runoff offering good trout fishing through May. In June, 
        since NYC releases only minimal flows from Pepacton, the water temperature 
        rises to the point where the Rainbows tend to slip back to the Main Delaware, 
        and Smallmouth Bass, and Shad become excellent targets for fly anglers. 
        The Upper East Branch, closer to Pepacton, still carries a good trout 
        population, and offers some good fly angling for most of the year. The 
        hatches on the East Branch are similar to the West Branch. Fall trout 
        fishing on the lower East Branch will usually be very good, since water 
        releases are often increased during that time.</p></td>

    <td><a name="ms" id="ms"></a>The upper reaches of <font color="#CC0000">The 
      Main Delaware River</font> receives most of its' water from the East and 
      West Branches, though there are more streams feeding the big river than 
      the two branches have. The main is a big river and it fishes big. Varying 
      on water levels, the Main Delaware will challenge your casting and wading 
      skills. We recommend taking a guided drift trip, a drift boat, pontoon, 
      or canoe for optimal fishing on the Main. The size of the wild Rainbows 
      and Browns in the river will make your efforts worthwhile. There are some 
      major size &quot;hogs&quot; in the Main, and though you will generally catch 
      less quantity of fish, the size of those you do hook into will challenge 
      your skills with long runs and tippet breaking power. The prolific hatches 
      on the &quot;Big D&quot; will be somewhat similar to the West and East Branches, 
      however, some big flies such as Brown and Green Drakes are in much greater 
      abundance. A size 14 Sulphur, E. rotunda, and size 12 to 14 Ephoron leukon, 
      aka The White Fly, is found in much greater quantity than on the branches. 
      Smallmouth and Shad fishing is also available to the fly angler on the Main 
      Delaware.</td>
