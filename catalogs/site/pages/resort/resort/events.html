      <br>
      The USAF Thunderbirds fly Lockheed Martin F-16's that can reach speeds up 
      to Fourteen-hundred miles an hour. Captain Dave Haworth from the Thunderbirds 
      says, &quot;It's a thrill, it's like going and seeing a rollercoaster ride 
      being built right in front of them, because that's what they're going to 
      see. Six demonstration planes, put on an air show like they've never seen 
      before.&quot; This is the Thunderbirds only performance in New York State 
      this summer. </td>

        longer than most of us have been fishing. He was a not only a very talented 
        fly fisherman and guide for the WBA, but a most accomplished fly tyer 
        as well. The quality and innovation of his comparadun patterns stood alone 
        to those who knew of his talent. His knowledge of entomology, trout behavior, 
        and of the system will be missed by all. He was a good friend and a true 
        gentleman. . for those qualities he will be even more sorely missed.</p></td>
