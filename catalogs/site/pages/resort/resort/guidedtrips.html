        River Guide services are available through the West Branch Angler from
        April 1 through October 31st of each season. Hunting guides are available
        according to the New York hunting seasons. The rivers that make up the
        Upper Delaware River System are challenging and offer excellent fly fishing,
        but you have to be on top of your game
      to consistently catch the wild trout that inhabit these major rivers. Whether
        you've fly fished the Delaware River System before or not, the best way
        to make the most efficient use of your fly fishing time is with one of
        our Professional Orvis Endorsed River Guides. They are experienced, knowledgeable
        fly fishermen who are courteous, and friendly - in other words they are
        real pros.<br>

        can arrange either wade trips or float trips for 1 or 2 people per guide.
        If possible, we heartily recommend going out in one of our guides' Mackenzie
        Drift Boats, since you will be able to cover more water and reach deeper
        prime fishing spots. The guide's job is to put you on working fish and
        a drift boat is the most efficient way to get it done. Our primary fishing
        is for wild Rainbows or wild Brown Trout, but we will gladly get you
        into Smallmouth Bass or Sea Run Shad during certain times of the year.
    Make your arrangements early, so we can accommodate the dates you desire.</div></td>

      <p>&quot;Wayne (Aldridge: a Wba Guide) Thanks for sending the photos so
        soon! Now I know it wasn't just a nice dream after all! Really appreciate
        your persistence on the water yesterday and had a great time fishing
        with you. Hope to do it again sometime soon when I'm back in NYC. Please
        keep me posted on the fishing, etc. Have a great season. </p>

        PS: Let me know if someone else catches that fish!&quot;

        <br>        &quot;Dear Joe (Demalderis: a WBA Guide)<br>
      I am writing to thank you for
        an absolutely delightful fly fishing float trip last week on the Delaware
        River. You taught me more about fishing in one day than I learned in
        a lifetime of fishing on my own. I'll be a better all around fisherman
        thanks to what I learned from you. I've been on other guided hunting
        and fishing trips in the past. But I can say unequivocally that I've
        never had a guide that worked as hard as you to satisfy the customer.
        I've already told my wife that I plan to do it again next year and I'll
      be requesting you as my guide.&quot;      <p>Robert S. New York</p>

      R. Warner with a some very kind words about his guide in 2003:<br>&quot; This is my second visit to West Branch and my guest from England who
        was a novice fly fisherman was thrilled we had as our guide John Dembeck.
        He is not only an exceptional guide but also an outstanding teacher.
        We both learned so much from him in one day it was incredible. While
        the weather was not all in our favor he successfully found rises and
        we caught a few. John's sense of humor and is extraordinary passion for
        the sport made our day so memorable. I intend to return many times in
        future and will surely request John. He is an essential asset to the
      West Branch.&quot;

      <p>Here is what Steve B. had to say about his WBA guided fishing trip this
        past 2003 season in an email to us: <br>
        &quot;
        I have only been fly fishing part time for about three years now and
        had never been on a guided fly trip. I was not disappointed at all. Gary
        (Henderson : a WBA guide) was understanding and patient as I practiced
        what HE preached. He was a terrific guide who I would recommend to all
        my pals. We caught some nice fish and I was able to understand the drift
        he was looking for. Now I need to practice, practice, practice. We experienced
        an unbelievable coffin fly/green drake hatch that was VERY exciting.
        This is my second journey to the West Branch Angler, and I look forward
    to future trips. Please thank Gary for me for a terrific day of fishing.&quot;</p></td>
