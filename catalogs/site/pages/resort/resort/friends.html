    <td>Friends of the Delaware? 
      <p>When are the &quot;Friends of the Upper Delaware&quot; not the friends 
        of the river system? <br>
        When the &quot;friends&quot; are employing &quot;the sky is falling&quot; 
        public negativity, possibly to such a degree, that the reputation of the 
        Upper Delaware River System is being harmed. When we see the &quot;friends&quot; 
        have only one single demand of 600 cubic feet per second release during 
        the summer, and this only applies to the West Branch. This one demand 
        does not address the way to achieve our long term hydrological needs for 
        the entire river system. Business wise, we certainly would not object 
        to a constant release of 600 CFS which would allow us to do guided float 
        trips all summer, and should produce more consistent fishing. So how do 
        we get to this &quot;ideal&quot; water level from where we are now?</p>
      <p>We have no problem with the use of facts made public through the media 
        and even political leverage done in a measured way to make our case. This 
        is how cooperation is achieved. Hard line approaches with unconfirmed 
        negative statements, without scientific fact, made public in the media, 
        may only serve to alienate those parties that have been negotiated with 
        to achieve the current short term gains for the entire system. A quote 
        by Michael Principe, Water Supply Director for New York City makes clear 
        what their position is regarding the 600 CFS release, &quot;Won't happen. 
        There just wouldn't be enough water.&quot; Whether this is a true statement 
        or not, would have to be proven. It will be proved true or false via a 
        myriad of studies planned for over the next three years of the current 
        flow agreements. Additionally we have a very deep concern that the negative 
        publicity via the &quot;Friends&quot; will turn off many of those fly 
        fishers who have supported the positive approach taken by the!<br>
        Delaware</p>
      <p>The approach we favor is to be perceived by all the parties, both pro 
        and con, as being tough but reasonable negotiators working for the long 
        term good of the entire Upper Delaware River System. It is our firm belief 
        that having an even handed approach based on proven fact is the correct 
        and most effective way of achieving these long term goals. We believe 
        this strategy of using factual data, employing political savvy, and working 
        with all other organizations which have the common objective of making 
        the entire upper Delaware River System the best fishery it can be, will 
        indeed work.</p>
      <p>This leaves the question of which organization does one support? We recognize 
        that the current minimum flow level agreements are not what we need for 
        the long term. We believe that having a positive attitude with all the 
        parties concerned, using political pressures that are available and continuing 
        with a balanced plan that supports the entire river system are the right 
        steps to eventually get the flows we need. We do not take our stand lightly. 
        Our resort at West Branch Angler has more to lose than anyone. We are 
        the largest outfitter on the Delaware River System with a strong commitment 
        to our guests to provide the best outdoor experience possible. NO ONE 
        has the financial investment, and pays more taxes than we do. With that 
        premise, we have made our decision to give our full support to the Delaware 
        River Foundation. Your support for the Foundation will allow them to continue 
        to make positive progress in protecting the entire Upper Delaware River 
        System for the good of all.</p>
