      <p align="left"><strong><font color="#003399"><br>
        Deposits:</font></strong><strong><font color="#006666"><br>
        </font></strong>50% deposit is required at time of reservation. Deposits 
        may be in the form of cash, money order or check. Reservations will not 
        be held and are not confirmed until a deposit has been received. If a 
        deposit has not been received at least 30 days prior to the date of arrival, 
        the reservation will be automatically cancelled. Credit cards are acceptable 
        for deposits only on reservations made 30 days prior to the date of the 
        actual stay. Deposits of 50% on guide trips are required at time of reservation. 
        Deposits are not transferable. <br>
        <br>
        <strong><font color="#003399">Cancellations/Refunds:</font></strong><br>
        If you cancel 14 days before your scheduled day of arrival, we will refund 
        your deposit, less 10% handling fee or apply your deposit to a future 
        stay within the current year. Cancellations with less than 14 days notice 
        do not qualify for a refund even if due to illness, work schedule changes 
        or inclement weather conditions. If you cancel with less than 14 days 
        notice, and we are able to fill your cancelled reservation, we will apply 
        your lodging deposit, less 10% handling fee, to a future stay during the 
        current year only. </p>
      <p align="left">Guides are independent contractors, therefore deposits are 
        forwarded directly to the guide. Deposits on canceled guide trips may 
        be applied to a future trip within the current year at the sole discretion 
        of the guide. <br>
